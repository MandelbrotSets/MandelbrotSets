### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Noah.
### I'm a **`Cloud Engineer`**.

I am an AWS Engineer with experience in deploying and managing infrastructure using CloudFormation and Terraform. I'm also proficient in AWS services such as CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Cognito, WAF, CloudFront, S3, DynamoDB, Load Balancers, VPC, Transit Gateways, Direct Connect, EC2, IAM Users & Roles, Organization, KMS, CodeBuild, CodeCommit, CodePipeline and serverless architecture.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also well-versed in Agile methodologies and use tools such as Jira to manage and track tasks and projects. I understand the importance of clear and concise communicaiton and documentation. This helps me to contribute, assist and help my team.

I also use PowerPoint to draw moving AWS architecture diagrams, this helps me to visualize and communicate the infrastructure design and dependencies to team members and stakeholders to minimize miscommunication in effective infrastructure building.

<summary><h3>Noah's Cloud Journey</h3></summary>
 
 I started my Cloud journey as a naive child listening to the harsh sounds of a DSL modem trying to connect to the internet. I wanted to know what those sounds meant and why there was a need for a DSL modem to get my family and I to AOL. **It's called a Modem Handshake by the way.** This lead me on the path of Networking but I had no idea what it was called at that time. Upon arrival to High School, I took Computer Science which opened me up into programming and Networking.  Some years later, I took and passed both the CompTIA Network+ as well as the CCNA certifications. My first role started me off with Network troubleshooting which gave way to other roles that would be in System Administration, NOC Support, and Remote Desktop support.  During this time, around 2014, the word "Cloud" had started to reach my ears and it fastly became a buzzword. I started to do my due dillegence in research and found AWS as the top Cloud provider.  I'd had the introduction of AWS, but then it was time to immerse myself into the Cloud world.  I obtained my AWS account and started the process of learning to build and destroy different AWS projects over and over again.  Next, I started building VPNs through VPCs within my role at work. Finally, I scheduled and passed two AWS certifications, Certified Cloud Practitioner and the Solutions Architect - Associate. I'm now 5 years into AWS Cloud and I'm constantly evolving along with it.
